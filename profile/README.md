## What is Paw Mac HTTP Client?

Paw Mac HTTP Client is a full-featured REST API testing environment built exclusively for macOS. It provides developers with a clean, code-free interface to design, debug, and test APIs efficiently.

The application supports all HTTP methods, authentication types, and dynamic values. You can easily manage environment variables, generate code snippets in multiple languages, and automate API workflows. Whether you're building a mobile app, a web service, or a microservice architecture, Paw helps you ensure that your APIs are reliable and well-documented.

Paw is fully optimized for macOS, including support for Dark Mode, Touch Bar, and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3). It runs seamlessly on MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Studio.
